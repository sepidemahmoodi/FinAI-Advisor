        "1. CORRELATED FEATURES\n",
        "   - If two features are highly correlated\n",
        "   - Importance might be split between them\n",

        "3. NOT CAUSAL\n",
        "   - High importance ≠ Feature causes the outcome\n",
        "   - Might be correlation, not causation\n",
        "   - Example: \"Ice cream sales\" and \"Swimming pool accidents\"\n",
